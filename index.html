          <p>With this website, I plan to not only document the
             progress of my web development skills, but also try to 
             answer the question of whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell's</a>
             <strong>10,000 hours theory</strong> is true or not, in the context of 
             coding.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I understand that this type of challenge is
            completely relative to what you are learning, both
            in it's complexity, and also the scope of the subject
            that is being studied. However, I believe that although one
            could put an endless amount of hours into any craft,
            to become a general <strong>"master"</strong> of your field, it
            is very much achievable within the 10,000 hour 
            estimate... and I think that you can actually reach 
            your learning target much faster than what you might 
            imagine.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            So please follow my progress and check back on this
            site regularly to track my learning and improvements.
          </p>

        <p>I have logged approx. 105 hours of learning to code so
           far, and this is just a little of what I can do off 
           the top of my head! I am super excited to keep going! 
           Stay tuned!!</p>
