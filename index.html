          <p>
            With this website, I plan to not only document the progress of my web development skills, but will also try to answer the question of whether Malcolm Gladwell's <b>10,000 hours theory</b> is true or not in the context of coding. In his book, "<a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">Outliers: The Story of Success</a>," Gladwell states that it takes 10,000 hours to master, or acheive world-class expertise in any skill.
          </br></br>
            I understand that this type of challenge is completely relative to what you are learning, both
            in it's complexity, and also the scope of the subject that is being studied. However, I believe that although one could put an endless amount of hours into any craft, to become a "master" of your field, it is very much achievable within the 10,000 hour estimate... and I think that you can actually reach your learning target much faster than what you might imagine.
          </br></br>
            So please follow my progress and check back on this site regularly to track my learning and improvements.
          </br></br>
            Thanks for visiting and please check out the other sections :-)
