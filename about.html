        Currently, I am a <strong>Multimedia Artist</strong>, specializing in <strong>Audiovisual Production</strong>. Other than working on a TV series, several TV commercials and promotional videos, plus one viral advertizement, I have worked in many other fields, ranging from my current day job in logistics, to the hospitality industry.
      </br></br>
        However, my most relevant work to coding has been my roles in the B2B and B2C sales world, working for technology-based companies. During my time living in London, I worked at CCA International selling broadband, TV, and telephone products and packages on behalf of British Telecom. Then I got a job at the now non-existent KGB Deals website, which was part of the online "daily deals" market, similar to the popular website run by Groupon. 
      </br></br>
        Now that I have discovered <strong>Coding</strong> and <strong>Web Development</strong>, these collective experiences have provided me with a platform to really expand on, because I can incorporate all of their aspects into practical ideas in a digital format to create web content and provide a unique and interactive user experience!
