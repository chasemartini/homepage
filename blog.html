        <p>So, this is my first <strong>blog post</strong>, hopefully one of many...
        At this point, I have logged just over <strong>60 hours</strong> of
        coding, learning <strong>HTML, CSS,</strong> and a little bit of
        <strong>Javascript</strong>. I am using <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">
        Codecademy</a> to learn the inintial ideas, and then I am
        using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>
        to go back over what I have learned, taking lots of notes,
        and then when I feel comfortable, applying them to my
        webpage here. I have been finding so far that although
        these sources are quite similar, they cover slightly
        different aspects, and are very complementary when used
        together. Other sources I have found useful have been the 
        numerous <strong>tutorials</strong> you can find through <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">
        YouTube</a></p>
    <br>
      <p>
        The first thing I would like to point you to, so that you 
        can see some programming in action, is the dog years 
        calculator I created at the bottom of this post. Just 
        underneath this entry, you will find a button, that when you 
        click it, my page will ask you for your age. When you enter 
        your age, it will determine how old you are in dog years. 
        At our home, we have  3 cats and 1 dog, so it's quite
        interesting to realize the value of their life by figuring 
        out how old you would be if you were in their shoes!
    <br>
    <br>
        So, the way I created the function that calculates your age 
        in dog years, is basically challenging the current
        misconception that every dog year equals 7 years in human
        years. The actual life span and aging of a dog dictates that
        the first 2 years of a dog's life is equal to 10.5 years 
        each. This means that by the time your dog is 2 years old, 
        they are 21 years old in respective terms. However, after 
        these first 2 years, aging slows to 4 years per human year. 
        Therefore the calculation is a little more complicated. So, 
        I have made it easy for you to see just how many years you 
        would have lived through if you were a dog.
    <br>
        Cool, right? :-)
